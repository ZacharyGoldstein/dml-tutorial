# Introduction
This is a tutorial for how to use the DoubleML package in R. The package implements Double/Debiased Machine Learning for estimating causal effects.

# Load Libraries
```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(DoubleML)
library(tidyverse)
library(causaldata)
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)
library(data.table)
set.seed(40601)
```

# Example Data

For this tutorial, we'll be using data from the Current Population Survey.

The data lets us study the effect of participation in a job-training program on
future wages.

The data is observational, participation was not randomized and we can not assume
that program participation is independent of the potential outcomes.

Besides the main treatment and outcome variables, we have data on some covariates that we hypothesize to be related to participation
and wages, including pre-program wages, race, age, educational attainment, and 
marital status.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going to assume that the observed covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. (comparisons with
randomized experiment data have shown this may not actually be the case)

```{r}
# Combine the randomized experiment data with the control-group-only observational data
df = cps_mixtape %>% bind_rows(nsw_mixtape)
df %>% head()
```

## Feature engineering

```{r}
df = df %>% 
  mutate(age_squared = age**2,
         age_under_35 = as.numeric(age<35),
         black_or_hispanic = as.numeric(black==1|hisp==1),
         # Average the income from the 2 years of data pre-program
         avg_pre_income = re74+re75/2,
         # Binary indicator for 12+ years of educational attainment
         educ_12_plus = as.numeric(educ>=12),
         )
```


# Partially Linear Model

## Theoretical Overview

Let's start with a relatively simple option for Double Machine Learning, the 
partially linear model. A partially linear model assumes a linear relationship
between the treatment and outcome, but makes no such assumptions about the 
relationships between the covariates and the outcome. We can use non-parametric
machine learning methods of our choice to model the relationship between the 
covariates and the outcome.

The model is as follows:
$$
Y = D\theta_0 + g_0(X) + \zeta
\\
D = m_0(X) + V
\\
E[\zeta|D,X] = 0
\\
E[V|X] = 0
$$

*Y* is the continuous outcome variable **re78**, real earnings in 1978.
*D* is the binary treatment variable **treat** corresponding to job training 
program participation.
$\theta_0$ is the effect of the treatment on the outcome.
$g_0$ is a possibly non-linear function of the covariates *X* that models their
relationship with the outcome.
*m* is the propensity score function that predictions the probability of 
program participation given the covariates *X*.
𝜁and *V* are random error terms.

## DoubleMLPLR function

### "New" method
The DoubleML R package implementation for the partially linear regression model is 
the function DoubleMLPLR. To create a new model, we use the "new" method,
as follows:

```{r,message=F}
l_rf = lrn("regr.ranger", max.depth = 5, min.node.size = 1)
m_rf = lrn("classif.ranger", max.depth = 3, min.node.size = 6)

non_covariates = c("data_id","treat","re78")
covariates = setdiff(names(df),non_covariates)
df_dml = df %>% 
  data.table %>% 
  double_ml_data_from_data_frame(y_col = "re78", d_cols = "treat",x_cols = covariates)

# Create a wrapper so I can set my own default parameters
# Then throughout the tutorial, I can make it clear which arguments deviate
# from the default in each example
DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper = function(data = df_dml,
  ml_l = l_rf,
  ml_m = m_rf,
  ml_g = NULL,
  n_folds = 5,
  n_rep = 1,
  score = "partialling out",
  dml_procedure = "dml2",
  draw_sample_splitting = TRUE,
  apply_cross_fitting = TRUE){
  model = DoubleMLPLR$new(
   data=data,ml_l=ml_l,ml_m=ml_m,ml_g=ml_g,n_folds=n_folds,n_rep=n_rep,
   score=score,dml_procedure=dml_procedure,
   draw_sample_splitting=draw_sample_splitting,
   apply_cross_fitting=apply_cross_fitting)
}

# Start out matching default parameters exactly
plm_ref = DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper()

plm_ref$fit()
```

```{r}
plm_ref
```


#### Score

The score is which formula we use for estimating $\theta_0$, the effect of the treatment
on the outcome. The package gives us two options for the partially linear model score, the 
"partialling out" score and the "IV-type" score. In the former, we
set `score='partialling out'` and set learners `ml_l` and `ml_m`. In the latter,
we set `score='IV-type` and set learners `ml_l`, `ml_m`, and `ml_g`.

The partialling out approach uses the following formula in
which $\hat{l_0}(X_i) = E(Y|X)$:
$$
\check{\theta}_0 = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i \hat{V}_i \right)^{-1} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i (Y_i - \hat{\ell}_0(X_i))
$$


And the IV-type uses the following formula:
$$\check{\theta}_0 = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i D_i\right)^{-1} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i (Y_i - \hat{g}_0(X_i))
$$

compare results using different function arguments, e.g. score in tutorial for DML

The partialling-out score partials out the associations between:
1) the covariates and the treatment
and between
2) the outcome and the covariates given treatment.

This is a form of orthogonalization, which is used to remove regularization bias.

The "IV-type" score is not intended for instrumental variables problems in which
we use a valid instrument to estimate a local average treatment effect even though
the potential outcomes can't be assumed to be independent of the treatment given
the observed covariates. DoubleML supports instrumental variables estimation,
but that's done with a separate function: `DoubleMLPLIV`. 

The "IV-type" is still intended for a selection-on-observables
problem in which all confounding variables are observed.
It is called "IV-type" because the scoring procedure
resembles that of an instrumental variables estimation procedure like 
two stage least squares. 

According to Chernozhukov and coauthors' 2018 paper, the two scores are 
"first-order equivalent." The DoubleML package user guide says that a minor
advantage of the partialling out estimator is that the nuisance parameters 
`l` and `m` can both be directly estimated using machine learning, whereas 
`g` (which is needed for the IV-type score) cannot.

```{r,message=F}
plm_iv_type = DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper(score = "IV-type",
                                      ml_g = l_rf$clone())
plm_iv_type$fit()
```
```{r}
plm_iv_type
```


#### Learners

The DoubleML package uses the mlr3 R package which supports many commonly used
supervised learning algorithms, including generalized linear models with 
regularization penalties, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, neural networks,
random forest, support vector machines, and gradient boosting.

You could also select an ensemble of different algorithms, or try multiple 
options and select the one with the best performance. 

The documentation shows regression algorithms are used for estimating l, m and g.
However, since m is a propensity score, it predicts a categorical outcome, so I
would imagine it is sensible to select a classification algorithm for it, as I 
have done in the default example in this tutorial, where I selected random forest
of regression trees for estimating the conditional mean function `l` and a random
forest of classification trees for estimating the propensity score `m`.
