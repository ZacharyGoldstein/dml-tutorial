# Introduction
This is a tutorial for how to use the DoubleML package in R. The package implements Double/Debiased Machine Learning for estimating causal effects.

# Load Libraries
```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(DoubleML)
library(tidyverse)
library(causaldata)
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)
library(data.table)
set.seed(40601)
```

# Example Data

For this tutorial, we'll be using data from the Current Population Survey.

The data lets us study the effect of participation in a job-training program on
future wages.

The data is observational, participation was not randomized and we can not assume
that program participation is independent of the potential outcomes.

Besides the main treatment and outcome variables, we have data on some covariates that we hypothesize to be related to participation
and wages, including pre-program wages, race, age, educational attainment, and 
marital status.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going to assume that the observed covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. (comparisons with
randomized experiment data have shown this may not actually be the case)

```{r}
# Combine the randomized experiment data with the control-group-only observational data
df = cps_mixtape %>% bind_rows(nsw_mixtape)
df %>% head()
```

## Feature engineering

```{r}
df = df %>% 
  mutate(age_squared = age**2,
         age_under_35 = as.numeric(age<35),
         black_or_hispanic = as.numeric(black==1|hisp==1),
         # Average the income from the 2 years of data pre-program
         avg_pre_income = re74+re75/2,
         # Binary indicator for 12+ years of educational attainment
         educ_12_plus = as.numeric(educ>=12),
         )
```


# Partially Linear Model

## Theoretical Overview

Let's start with a relatively simple option for Double Machine Learning, the 
partially linear model. A partially linear model assumes a linear relationship
between the treatment and outcome, but makes no such assumptions about the 
relationships between the covariates and the outcome. We can use non-parametric
machine learning methods of our choice to model the relationship between the 
covariates and the outcome.

The model is as follows:
$$
Y = D\theta_0 + g_0(X) + \zeta
$$
$$
D = m_0(X) + V
$$
$$
E[\zeta|D,X] = 0
$$
$$
E[V|X] = 0
$$

*Y* is the continuous outcome variable **re78**, real earnings in 1978.
*D* is the binary treatment variable **treat** corresponding to job training 
program participation.
$\theta_0$ is the effect of the treatment on the outcome.
$g_0$ is a possibly non-linear function of the covariates *X* that models their
relationship with the outcome.
*m* is the propensity score function that predictions the probability of 
program participation given the covariates *X*.
𝜁and *V* are random error terms.

## DoubleMLPLR function

The DoubleML R package implementation for the partially linear regression model is 
the function DoubleMLPLR. To create a new model, we use the "new" method,
as follows:

```{r,message=F,results='hide'}
l_rf = lrn("regr.ranger", max.depth = 5, min.node.size = 1)
m_rf = lrn("classif.ranger", max.depth = 3, min.node.size = 6)

non_covariates = c("data_id","treat","re78")
covariates = setdiff(names(df),non_covariates)
df_dml = df %>% 
  data.table %>% 
  double_ml_data_from_data_frame(y_col = "re78", d_cols = "treat",x_cols = covariates)

# Create a wrapper so I can set my own default parameters
# Then throughout the tutorial, I can make it clear which arguments deviate
# from the default in each example
DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper = function(data = df_dml,
  ml_l = l_rf,
  ml_m = m_rf,
  ml_g = NULL,
  n_folds = 5,
  n_rep = 1,
  score = "partialling out",
  dml_procedure = "dml2",
  draw_sample_splitting = TRUE,
  apply_cross_fitting = TRUE){
  model = DoubleMLPLR$new(
   data=data,ml_l=ml_l,ml_m=ml_m,ml_g=ml_g,n_folds=n_folds,n_rep=n_rep,
   score=score,dml_procedure=dml_procedure,
   draw_sample_splitting=draw_sample_splitting,
   apply_cross_fitting=apply_cross_fitting)
}

# Start out matching default parameters exactly
plm_ref = DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper()

plm_ref$fit()
```

Printing the model outputs a summary of the variables and methodological parameters.
Then it prints out a summary of the results, including the point estimate, 
standard error, test statistic, and p-value for the average treatment effect. 
```{r}
plm_ref
```


### Score

The score is which formula we use for estimating $\theta_0$, the effect of the treatment
on the outcome. The package gives us two options for the partially linear model `score` argument, the 
"partialling out" score and the "IV-type" score. In the former, we
set `score='partialling out'` and set learners `ml_l` and `ml_m`. In the latter,
we set `score='IV-type` and set learners `ml_l`, `ml_m`, and `ml_g`.

The partialling out approach uses the following formula in
which $\hat{l_0}(X_i) = E(Y|X)$:
$$
\check{\theta}_0 = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i \hat{V}_i \right)^{-1} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i (Y_i - \hat{\ell}_0(X_i))
$$


And the IV-type uses the following formula:
$$
\check{\theta}_0 = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i D_i\right)^{-1} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i\in I} \hat{V}_i (Y_i - \hat{g}_0(X_i))
$$


The partialling-out score partials out the associations between:
1) the covariates and the treatment
and between
2) the outcome and the covariates given treatment.

This is a form of orthogonalization, which is used to remove regularization bias.

The "IV-type" score is not intended for instrumental variables problems in which
we use a valid instrument to estimate a local average treatment effect even though
the potential outcomes can't be assumed to be independent of the treatment given
the observed covariates. DoubleML supports instrumental variables estimation,
but that's done with a separate function: `DoubleMLPLIV`. 

The "IV-type" is still intended for a selection-on-observables
problem in which all confounding variables are observed.
It is called "IV-type" because the scoring procedure
resembles that of an instrumental variables estimation procedure like 
two stage least squares. 

According to Chernozhukov and coauthors' 2018 paper, the two scores are 
"first-order equivalent." The DoubleML package user guide says that a minor
advantage of the partialling out estimator is that the nuisance parameters 
`l` and `m` can both be directly estimated using machine learning, whereas 
`g` (which is needed for the IV-type score) cannot.

```{r,message=F,results='hide'}
plm_iv_type = DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper(score = "IV-type",
                                      ml_g = l_rf$clone())
plm_iv_type$fit()
```
```{r}
plm_iv_type
```

### Learners

The DoubleML package uses the mlr3 R package which supports many commonly used
supervised learning algorithms, including generalized linear models with 
regularization penalties, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, neural networks,
random forest, support vector machines, and gradient boosting.

You could also select an ensemble of different algorithms, or try multiple 
options and select the one with the best performance. 

The documentation shows regression algorithms are used for estimating l, m and g.
However, since m is a propensity score, it predicts a categorical outcome, so I
would imagine it is sensible to select a classification algorithm for it, as I 
have done in the default example in this tutorial, where I selected random forest
of regression trees for estimating the conditional mean function `l` and a random
forest of classification trees for estimating the propensity score `m`.

### DML Procedure

The DML package gives us two options for the `dml_procedure` argument, "dml1" and
"dml2". This lets us choose between two slightly different algorithms.

"dml1" estimates the causal parameters first on each of k folds of the data
separately, and then averages them together for an estimate of the causal 
parameter.

In the following equations:
*N* is the sample size of the data.
*K* is the number of folds (and *k* is a single fold)
*n* is the sample size of a single fold (N/K)
*I* is a single fold.
$\psi$ is the score function.

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in I_k} \psi(W_i; \check{\theta}_{0,k}, \hat{\eta}_{0,k}) = 0.
$$
$$
\tilde{\theta}_0 = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \check{\theta}_{0,k}.
$$

"dml2" estimates the causal parameters in a single step by solving an equation
involving a double summation, first over the folds, and then over the entries within each fold.

$$
 \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i \in I_k} \psi(W_i; \tilde{\theta}_0, \hat{\eta}_{0,k}) = 0.
$$

According to the paper, DML2 is generally recommended over DML1, however there 
are some problems (e.g. ATE estimation in the interactive model) where either approach
yields the same result. DML2 is generally recommended because the pooled empirical
Jacobian is more stable than the separate empirical Jacobians. They also note that
DML2 may behave better in small samples.

Since `dml2` is the default, here I'll show a version using `dml1`.

```{r,results='hide'}
plm_dml1 = DoubleMLPLR_new_wrapper(dml_procedure = "dml1")
plm_dml1$fit()
```

```{r}
plm_dml1
```


### Cross Fitting

To avoid overfitting bias, Double Machine Learning splits the sample into subsets.
The *g* and *m* models are estimated using one subset, while the scoring estimation
is performed with the other subset. This is done in the `DoubleMLPLR$new` function by setting `draw_sample_splitting` to `TRUE`. It is always a good idea to do sample splitting for DML, so if you set this argument to `FALSE`, you'll want to do sample splitting separately using a more customized approach with the `set_sample_splitting` method.

However, a weakness of sample-splitting is 
the loss of statistical power since each part of the estimation is only being
done with half the sample size. 
To maintain the ability to evaluate on a held-out set without a loss of power, the authors propose "cross-fitting", in which 
sample-splitting is done twice, with each half of the data getting a turn to do
each step. Then, the results are averaged together. You can use cross-fitting by leaving the `apply_cross_fitting` argument at its default value of `TRUE`.

However, having two equally-sized folds, one for nuisance parameter estimation
and one for scoring is not the only option. The authors propose another approach
in which the data is split into k equally-sized parts, such as k=5, and each time
all but one of the folds is used for nuisance parameter estimation, while just one
is used for scoring. This is implemented in the DML package by setting the `n_folds`
argument.

The authors find that standard errors of estimates are generally lower when
using 5-fold cross-fitting than 2-fold. The estimates are more precise when
most of the data is used to estimate the nuisance parameters than when the data
is split evenly between the two parts of the procedure. However, it is not as 
straightforward a relationship as "the more folds, the more precise the estimates".
The optimal number of folds seems to depend on a number of factors, and is not fully understood.

#### Repeated Cross-Fitting

By default, cross-fitting only happens once. But if you change
`n_rep` to a value higher than 1, cross-fitting will be repeated `n_rep` times.

The advantage of repeated cross-fitting is that it can 
reduce sensitivity to particular sample splits. You can
then calculate the point estimate as the median of the point estimates across all the different splits. You can also use the repeated cross-fitting to estimate a standard error. The procedure for this is described in Zivich et al (2021).

The advantage of just doing a single round of cross-fitting is it reduces the 
runtime needed to carry out the procedure, as well as simplifying 
the cross-fitting process.

## Inference

### Bootstrapping

DML supports bootstrapping of coefficients and t-statistics using the `bootstrap()`
method and the `boot_coef` and `boot_t_stat` attributes. It supports a "normal",
"wild", and "Bayes" bootstrap method. The number of resamples is specified by the
`n_rep_boot` argument.

For example:
```{r}
boot_results = plm_ref$bootstrap(method='normal',n_rep_boot=500)
boot_results$boot_coef[1:10]
boot_results$boot_t_stat[1:10]
```

You can then use the bootstrapped results to estimate standard errors and 
confidence intervals.

### Confidence Intervals

Here's a 95% confidence interval for the average treatment effect:
```{r}
boot_results$confint(joint=F,level=.95)
```

It contains zero, suggesting the result is not statistically significant.

# Beyond the PLR Model

The DML package also supports more complex models than the partially linear 
regression model. 

## Instrumental Variables

If you have an instrumental variable, that is, a variable that exogenously affects the treatment without having a separate effect on the outcome, you can use `DoubleMLPLIV` to model that.

## Clustered Data

The DML package supports cluster-robust cross-fitting for 
clustered data using `DoubleMLClusterData`.

## Interactive Regression

An interactive regression model using `DoubleMLIRM` does not assume that the treatment has a simple linear relationship with the outcome. It allows for interactions between the treatment term and the covariates. 

The DML package also supports interactive regression models with instrumental variables using `DoubleMLIIVM`.
